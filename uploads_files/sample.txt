Cricket is often called the gentleman's game, but the intensity of the rivalry, especially between teams like India and Pakistan, makes it a fiercely competitive sport. The sport is played with a bat and ball on a 22-yard pitch. There are three main formats: Test matches, which last up to five days and are the ultimate test of endurance; One Day Internationals (ODIs), which are faster-paced with 50 overs per side; and the modern Twenty20 (T20), which is quick, explosive, and perfect for stadium crowds and television audiences.

A key position is the **bowler**, who tries to dismiss the **batsman** by hitting the wicket behind them. If the batsman successfully defends, they try to score runs by running between the wickets. Famous cricketers like Sachin Tendulkar, known as the "Master Blaster," and the legendary Sir Donald Bradman, who had an unbelievable Test batting average of 99.94, are central figures in the game's history. The sport's major international tournament is the **Cricket World Cup**, held every four years, which showcases the best teams from around the globe.
